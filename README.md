# Checkers
My AI Project for 2nd year of college.

This code works on minimax algorithm. 

Modules imported are Pygame and Copy ...

Project contain five files in particular.

File 1 (Checkers) : consisting of 5 more .py files and is majorly related to the development of board, pieces, and game in general.
+ __init__.py to make Python treat directories containing it as modules.
+ board.py for all board movements as well as shape of the board.
+ constraints.py to keep all the constant values of the game that rarely changes secluded.
+ game.py consists of all game rules and real-time functions.
+ piece.py for functions defining information as wellas conversions of pieces.

File 2 (Assets) : consists of a single file crown.ong for importing it to constaints.py to put in on king pieces.

File 3 (Minimax) : consists of files for bot that wll be the checker game. It has 2 .py files in it.
+ __init__.py to make Python treat directories containing it as modules.
+ consists of bot that works on minimax algorithm and returns best move.

File 4 (__init__.py) : to make Python treat directories containing it as modules.

File 4 (main.py) ; Parent file of whole program
